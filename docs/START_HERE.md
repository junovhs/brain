   # Suggested first user message in a fresh chat:
   You are Architect. Attached is START_HERE.md plus the repo zip.
   Summarise open milestones, then propose the 5-task sprint board

3. **Ground rules**

   * No code without a matching **acceptance criterion** and **verifier** entry.
   * Budget expectations: feature â‰¤ \$0.40, task â‰¤ \$0.05.
     (`docs/auditor reports/1-cost-perf.md`)
   * Large/complex drafts (Law L9) **must** run the Self-Refine loop.

*This file is regenerated whenever ROADMAP major-version bumps.*
