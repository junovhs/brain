### System Integrity Audit Report

*(Red-Team Systems Architect — Phase II Implementation-Assurance Review)*

#### 1. Threat-Model Analysis

| Attack Surface / Failure Domain           | Adversary Goal / Failure Vector                   | Exposure                            | Potential Impact                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **WASM Verifier Sandbox**                 | Escape to host FS / network via sys-call gadgetry | Medium (Wasmtime caps configurable) | Unauthorized code exec ⇒ data exfil / corruption |
| **Hash-Chained Audit Logs**               | Delete / edit log entries to hide actions         | Low (real-time chaining)            | Forensic blind-spot; compliance breach           |
| **Atomic State Files (`tasks.yaml`, DB)** | Partial write or torn-rename                      | Medium                              | Task graph corruption ⇒ silent logic bombs       |
| **Prompt-Injection on Architect/Coder**   | Inject shell paths, escalate privileges           | Medium                              | Malicious code committed & merged                |
| **API-Key Handling**                      | Read or overwrite Gemini key                      | Low (OS keystore + Argon2id)        | Unlimited spend, model misuse                    |

#### 2. Data-Integrity Stress-Test

| Scenario                                                     | Mitigation Present                                                                  | Gaps                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A – Corrupted Write** (power loss mid-`tasks.yaml`)        | Temp-file + atomic rename; SHA-256 checksum in manifest; rollback if checksum fails | Need automated fuzz test that crashes between fsync & rename                                                     |
| **B – Malicious Import** (LLM emits path-traversal filename) | Input-Validator normalises paths; Sandbox verifier executes in RO FS                | Path normalisation unit-tests cover ASCII; missing Unicode homoglyph cases                                       |
| **C – Faulty Rule / Automation** (infinite verify loop)      | Retry cap = 1; budget ledger aborts on overrun                                      | If verifier passes but code semantically wrong, loop may resurface later; future static-analysis flagged as TODO |

---

#### 3. Collaboration / Sync Vulnerability Assessment

* Single-user local-first; Git provides history.
* Merge conflicts on `tasks.yaml` resolved by three-way diff; checksum re-calculated post-merge.
* Schema version stamped in every snapshot; loader supports N and N-1; migration tool with down-grade path.
* Patch ingestion (future) must reuse Input-Validator rules—no `../` traversal, size ≤ 1 MiB.

---

#### 4. Observability & Forensics Sufficiency

* **100 % OTel span coverage** on critical paths; attributes include `gen_ai.*`, `error.type`.
* Audit log entry links `trace_id`+`span_id` → perfect correlation.
* Failure of audit-log write ⇒ primary op aborts (tested).
* OTel exporter failure ⇒ spans dropped but audit trail intact (acceptable for local CLI).
* Forensics blind-spot: lost spans when offline; acceptable Phase II risk.

---

#### 5. Cost & Resource Abuse

* `ResourceGovernor` hard-caps per-call and per-feature spend; WAL ledger prevents TOCTOU.
* Local tokenizer ±5 % accuracy verified against API.
* Kill-switch: SIGINT handled by `ShutdownManager`, cancels in-flight LLM; ledger rollbacks to last durable snapshot.

---

#### 6. Compliance & Privacy

* Data-class mapping complete; PII excluded from default logs (hash-only).
* SQLCipher encryption key lifecycle documented; Argon2id parameters meet NIST 800-63-B.
* SOC 2 CC7.x controls traceable: CC7.1 (logging), CC7.2 (tamper evidence), CC7.3 (incident response).
* GDPR cross-border transfer disclosed; user is controller.

---

#### 7. Final Verdict — **Robust (with Verification Pending)**

Architecture now resists catastrophic failure modes. Remaining risk is quality of hostile-test coverage and checksum-fuzz harnesses.

---

#### 8. Mandated Hardening (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Hostile WASM Suite v1** — prove sandbox blocks FS escape, network, and >256 MB mem allocation.
2. **Checksum-Crash Fuzzer** — simulate power loss between `write()` and `rename()` for `tasks.yaml`; demonstrate auto-recovery.
3. **Unicode Path Normalisation Tests** — extend Input-Validator to reject homoglyph / NF-D tricks.
4. **Ledger Integrity Monitor** — nightly job verifies WAL sums match audit-log token counts.
5. **Quarterly Wasmtime CVE Review** — policy document + CI check that runtime ≤ 30 days behind latest security patch.

*All five items must ship with reproducible test evidence before Phase II can be declared production-ready.*
