    // TODO: Implement the full Hierarchical Semantic Sketch logic.
    // 1.  Use tree-sitter to parse all files in the project to build an AST/symbol graph.
    // 2.  Use FTS5 (from SQLite) or embedding search on the `query.prompt` to find
    //     high-ranking starting nodes in the graph.
    // 3.  Perform a "budget walk" from those nodes, adding file/function signatures
    //     and bodies to the `context_package` until `query.token_budget` is reached.
    // 4.  For now, we will return a placeholder message.
